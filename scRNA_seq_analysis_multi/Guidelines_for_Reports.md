### 3. Unzip GSE179633_RAW.tar.gz directly or Unzip GSE179633_RAW.tar.gz using "tar -xvzf" command on your terminal.

## Report format
### 1. Please write the report based on the results of scRNA-seq data analysis using two biological samples, DLE1113E & SLE1116E.
### 2. Free format, but must contain (1) UMAP visualization, (2) Canonical marker gene expression <on UMAP 2D embedding space or in Violin plot or in Dot plot>, (3) Code & Results for Cell type annotation and DEG analysis.
### 3. If you have any problems, including memory issues, you "must" inform me of the issues by email. If reasonable, you can write the report using one of two samples.
### 4. If your problems remain after using only one sample, or if you cannot use your computer due to any issues, you can write the report based on the paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35209-1).
### 5. The due date for the report is before the final exam (December 19, 11:59 PM).
#### 5-1. Even if you submit your report after the deadline, I'll not give you zero. However, a penalty will be applied based on the exponential decay function of the number of hours elapsed since the deadline.
#### 5-2. For your convenience in preparing the report, alternative options such as those described in 3. or 4. above have been provided. However, if you abuse this policy by notifying me of such issues only right before the due date, or by using these alternative options to write and submit your report without any prior communication, the score for your report will start with a 50% deduction.
